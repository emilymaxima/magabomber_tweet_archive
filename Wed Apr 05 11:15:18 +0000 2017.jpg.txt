If there was ever a really bad time to appoint a woman who is best
known for lying to the media to a top position, it would be now. But
Obama is clearly too arrogant to care.

Nowhe is "getting his way" by appointing her National Security Adviser
even though the main things she is known for are lying about Benghaa

and supporting African dictators.

 

 

But considering the complete lack of actual national security in this
administration, Susan Rice is as unqualified as anyone to advise on it
Undoubtedly the center of this story as presented in the mainstream US
media will be the continued conflict between Obama and congressional
Republicans who have used the attacks in Benghad, and Rice's attempt
to cover up the true nature of the terrorist act, as ammunition in their
political assault on the administration. Conversely, Obama's
appointment will be seen as a stern response to the Republican bid for
"character assassination" of Rice, as Obama no longer worries about a
reelection campaign.

As Mark Landler wrote in the New York Times, "[The appointment of
Susan Rice]is also a defiant gesture to Republicans who harshly
criticized Ms. Rice for presenting an erroneous account of the deadly
attacks on the American mission in Benghad, Libya... For Ms. Rice,

the appointment amounts to redemption."
