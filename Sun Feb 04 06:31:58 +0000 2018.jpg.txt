SPREAD THEIR SHAME

At the very last minute, Arizona Senators
John McCain and Jeff Flake just snuck a provision into
a must-pass military funding bill that gave away holy
Apache land to an Australian-British mining company
that plans to turn it into a 1,000-foot-deep crater.
It is the first time in American history that Congress
has handed over a public, sacred Native American site
to a foreign owned multinational corporation.
