CONGRESS

SHOULD LIVE
Ua SY

LAWS

Members of Congress were
given an option to exempt
themselves and their staffs from
Obamacare. Predictably, many
of them chose to do so and
retained their existing
healthcare benefits. Obamacare
rates are now skyrocketing
across the country and
punishing American families. If
citizens are forced to live under
Obamacare, members of
Congress and their staffers
should too.
