Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and his wife, Jane Sanders have hired prominent
defense attorneys amid an FBI investigation into a loan Jane Sanders obtained to
expand Burlington College while she was its president, CBS News confirms.

Politico Magazine first reported the Sanders had hired lawyers to defend them in
the probe. Sandersâ€™ top adviser Jeff Weaver told CBS News the couple has sought
legal protection over federal agents' allegations from a January 2016 complaint
accusing then-President of Burlington College, Ms. Sanders, of distorting donor
levels in a 2010 loan application for $10 million from People's United Bank to
purchase 33 acres of land for the institution.

According to Politico, prosecutors might also be looking into allegations that Sen.
Sanders' office inappropriately urged the bank to approve the loan.
