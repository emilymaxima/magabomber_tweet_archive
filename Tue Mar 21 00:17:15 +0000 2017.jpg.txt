HYPOCRISY, THY
NAME IS DEMOCRAT

“With respect to the Supreme Court at least, I will
recommend to my colleagues that we should not
confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court."
~ Chuck Schumer 199

 

"[Republicans] don't even know who the president's
going to propose and they said, no... This kind of
obstructionism isn’t going to last. And you know, we
Democrats didn’t do this." ~ Chuck Schumer 2016
