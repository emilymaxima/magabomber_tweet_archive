VOTE FOR GARY JOHNSON TO END THE
EXPLOITATION OF MIGRANT WORKERS NOW!

The Democrats and Republicans only serve their
political donors. This is pay-to-play corruption.

They only do the bidding of the people who give
them the most money.

Some of these political donors want to exploit migrant
workers by paying them slave wages. That is why they
encourage “illegal” immigration.

It is also why the Democrats did not pass immigration
reform in 2008 when they had control of congress.

They want to keep this underground economy.
GARY JOHNSON WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO

OBTAIN WORK VISAS, THUS ENDING WORKER
EXPLOITATION AND “ILLEGAL” IMMIGRATION.
