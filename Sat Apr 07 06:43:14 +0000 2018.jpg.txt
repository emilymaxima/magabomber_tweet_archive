President Jimmy Carter

Many Americans continued to blame
Nixon and the Republican party for
the Watergate scandal.

Jimmy Carter, a Democrat from
Georgia, ran against and defeated
Pres. Ford in 1976.

Carter promised to ‘clean up’
Washington and end corruption.

 

Like Pres. Ford, Carter’s main
problem was the U.S. economy.
Inflation was 10%, interests rates at
21% and price of oil continued rising.
