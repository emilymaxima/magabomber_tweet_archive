BOTH OF THESE GENTLEMAN ARE WRONG
FOR SUPPORTING OBSTRUCTION

OMT TCM

Senator John McCain and Senator Chuck Schumer
are both WRONG for supporting obstruction
of a sitting President; and his duty to nominate
a Supreme Court Justice.

So are any other politicians who agree with this tactic.
President Obama should nominate. The nominee
should be vetted. And a public hearing should take place.
