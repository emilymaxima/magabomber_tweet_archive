FBI Director Received Millions From Clinton Foundation-
His Brother's Law Firm Does Clinton’s Taxes

It appears that James Comey did not recommend federal charges against Hillary Clinton, in part
because he is connected to the Clinton Foundation through the Swiss bank HSBC.

      

 

 

More than 200 republicans sent a letter demanding to know why he didn’t recommend federal charges
against Hillary Clinton over her use of private email servers. Clinton “clearly placed our nation’s secrets
in peril,” the letter states. “No one is above the law, and the American people deserve a more robust
explanation for your decision to not recommend criminal charges.”

 

According to Mit .a review of FBI Director James Comey's professional history and relationships
shows that the Obama cabinet leader — now under fire for his handling of the investigation of Hillary
Clinton — is deeply entrenched in the big-money cronyism culture of Washington, D.C. His personal and
professional relationships — all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton
— reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe.

These concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense
contractor, Comey's former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partner's board, and his
surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the
Clinton Foundation’s taxes.
