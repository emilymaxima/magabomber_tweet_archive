Scientific Observation Reveals Jets Are Spraying Aerosols - Not Contrails

Circles in frames A, B and D show aerosol emissions that cannot possibly meet
the USAF of NASA definition of “contrails” due to the absence of a transparent
vapor gap between the hot engine exhaust and visible ice crystal formations.

The arrows in frame B and C point to anomalous aerosol emissions unrelated

2| to normal water vapor contrail formation. These aerosols appear to be released

from the fuselage of the aircraft.
