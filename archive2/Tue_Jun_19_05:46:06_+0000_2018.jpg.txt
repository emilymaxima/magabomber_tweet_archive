Not Kennedy, but Roosevelt!

Theodore Roosevelt's ideas on Immigrants and being an
AMERICAN in 1907.
\ a “In the first’place, we should insist:that if
the immigrant who, comes: herein good
faith becomes an American and assimi-
lates*himself torus; he shall be treated on
an exact equality with everyone else, for it
is an outrage to discriminate against any
such man because of creed, or birthplace, or
origin. But this is, predicated: upon:the per-
son's becoming in every facet an’American,
and nothing but/an’Aimerican...There can be
no divided allegiance here. Any man who

Theodore Roosevelt cays he is an American, but something else
also, isn’t an American at all. We have'toom for but one’ flag; the
‘Amorican flage. We have room for but one language’here, and
that is-the-Bnglish language. and we have room for ‘but one sole
loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people’
