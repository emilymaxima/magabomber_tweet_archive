START

Government steals money from everyone. Money is re-directed to union workers
such as police / fire / teachers.
Who could be against that!?

And the process starts again...

  
  
 
      
   
  
  

Once in power, they stay there forever!
Every demand for a tax increase, is
really a demand for re-election funds.
--And you are paying for it!

If they want to keep their jobs, and
â„¢& the money rolling in, they better vote
democrat.
