Maxine Waters has passed 3 Bills in 27 years and was labeled
the most corrupt member in Congress 4 times in the last 12
years by Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics in Washington

Maxine Waters was elected to Congress in the year of 1990. During
her time in Congress, her family has made over a million dollars in
revenue from Waters’ government connections. Throughout Waters’
27 years in Congress, she only managed to pass three bills: a Haiti
relief bill, the renaming of a post office, and a modification of the
national flood insurance program. Additionally, Waters failed to
gain much popularity in Congress. Citizens For Responsibility and
Ethics in Washington labeled her as the most corrupt member in
Congress during the years of 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2011.

A few years ago, Waters was charged by the House ethics
committee for allegedly securing bailout funds for a bank in

which her husband owned stock. She received three counts of
violating House rules in addition to the federal ethics code. These
charges were linked to her moves to establish a meeting between
OneUnited bank representatives and Treasury officials in 2008. The
committee stated that Waters’ moves to benefit OneUnited bank
would serve as personally beneficial to her own interests due to her
husband’s ownership of stock. The Congresswoman and her attorney
filed a motion to have the charges dismissed, but unsurprisingly, the
ethics panel denied it.
