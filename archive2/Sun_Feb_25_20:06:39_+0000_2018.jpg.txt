Ever Wonder Why Republicans
Want Voter ID ?

*In 59 voting districts in the Philadelphia region, Obama received 100%

of the votes - with not even a single vote recorded for Romney.

(A mathematical and statistical impossibility)

*In 21 districts in Wood County Ohio, Obama received 100% of the votes
where GOP inspectors were illegally removed from their polling locations -
and not one single vote was recorded for Romney. (A statistical impossibility)
*in Wood County Ohio, 106,258 voted in a county with 98,213 eligible voters...

*In St. Lucie County, FL, there were 175,574 registered voters but 247,713
votes were cast.

*Palm Beach County, FL had a 141% voter turnout.

*In one Ohio County, Obama won by 108% of the total number of eligible
voters,

NOW for a FUN FACT:
Obama won in every state that did not require
a Photo ID and lost in every state that did require
a Photo ID in order to vote.
