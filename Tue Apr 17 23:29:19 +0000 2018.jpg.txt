Senator John McCain, Paul Ryan, and Marco Rubio all received generous funding from
George Soros in 2016, and McCain's financial association with the globalist billionaire dates
back to at least 2001, according to a new report by OpenSecrets.org.

The non-profit, non-partisan research group based in Washington, D.C., that tracks the effects of
money and lobbying on elections and public policy, revealed that while George Soros is
responsible for funding Democrats and progressive causes, he has also bankrolled Senator John
McCain and a small but select group of other Republicans.
