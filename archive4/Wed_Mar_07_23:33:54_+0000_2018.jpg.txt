THE BANKING ACT UF ee

5
ed

Also known as Blass-Steagall, the Banking Act of 1933
effectively separated risky speculative investment
banking from traditional, FOIC protected functions like
issuing mortgages and small business loans. The repeal
of this law by Bill Clinton in 1999 led directly to the
toxic mortgage-fueled meltdown of 2008... the root
cause of our current economic situation.
